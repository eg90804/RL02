Enhancements for next release

Have a 2nd channel on the USB to act as a status register, so pseudo drive status 
register bits can be examined by the host.

In new rev of board, have the 'drive ready' signal also fed into the uC
so it knows if the drive is ready. Now this signal is only fed into the FPGA

In new rev of board, have the 'drive error' signal also fed into the uC
so it knows if the drive has a fault. Now this signal is not used.

In new rev of board, have the 'status' signal also fed into the uC.
For possible future use?

In new rev of board, have the 'status clock' signal also fed into the uC.
For possible future use?
